# PhyloCalc

## Introduction
PhyloCalc is a powerful Python module that allows you to calculate the probability of a phylogenetic tree without relying on the Biopython library. It provides a solution for analyzing the likelihood of evolutionary relationships based on DNA sequence data, and was developed as part of the Advanced Python Programming Course at the University of Lausanne's first-year Master of Molecular Life Sciences program.

## Key Features
- **Phylogenetic Tree Probability Calculation**: PhyloCalc can compute the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree using the provided DNA sequences, tree structure, and branch lengths.
- **FASTA File Support**: The module can seamlessly integrate with FASTA files, allowing users to work with their DNA sequence data.
- **Tree Structure Parsing**: PhyloCalc can interpret and process tree structures in a tabular format, making it easy to work with various tree representations.
- **Customizable Substitution Models**: Users can adjust the substitution model parameters to fine-tune the probability calculation and better fit their specific research needs.
- **Visualization**: The module can generate visual representations of the phylogenetic tree, enhancing the understanding of the evolutionary relationships.
